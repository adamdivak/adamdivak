### Hi, I'm Adam,

I study AI, develop software in C++ and Python, and lead engineering teams. Most recently I have worked on the prediction module of the highway autopilot system of BMW. Prior to that I led autonomous driving development at AImotive (owned by Stellantis group now), ran a small startup, and created a conference administration system.

Currently I focus on studying AI full time at the University of Amsterdam. Check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tvIknpUDykpwrTblMxDeawGgSM3IJsZP/view?usp=sharing) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamdivak/) for more information.

### Public projects

I did the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013). Projects in the course cover all major parts of a self-driving software, some of which are here:

- **Detection**
  - [udacity_sd_lidar_fusion](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_lidar_fusion) - Lidar 3D object detection using FPN ResNet, Darknet and Tensorflow in the Waymo Open Data Set
  - (coming soon) - Camera 3D object detection in the Waymo data set
  - [udacity_sd_traffic_sign_classification](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_traffic_sign_classification) - Traffic sign classification based on the LeNet architecture with dropout, regularization and hyperparameter optimization
  - [udacity_sd_advanced_lanes_cv](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_advanced_lanes_cv) - Advanced lane detection using traditional CV algorithms. Calibration, birds-eye view perspective transformation, sliding windows based lane finding and temporal tracking
  - [udacity_sd_basic_lanes_cv](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_basic_lanes_cv) - Basic lane detection using traditional CV algorithms. Thresholding, Canny edge detection, line clustering using DBSCAN, ego lane separator selection and visualization
- **Sensor fusion**
  - [udacity_sd_lidar_fusion](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_lidar_fusion) - Lidar-camera fusion with data association, track management and object tracking using an Extended Kalman Filter
- **Localization**
  - (coming soon)
- **Planning and Control**
  - [udacity_sd_planning](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_planning) - Basic behavior and motion planning tested in Carla. State machine-based behavior planning, motion planning using cubic spirals, velocity profile generation and cost-function based trajectory selection with static collision checking
  - [udacity_sd_control](https://github.com/yosuah/udacity_sd_control) - Control and trajectory tracking for AVs tested in Carla. Implementing separate PID controllers for throttle and steering, controller parameter tuning using the twiddle algorithm, and some fixes to the original planner and simulator client
